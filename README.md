# AirBNB Listings Display Project

**AIRBNB Listings Display** - A responsive web application that uses AJAX (JavaScript fetch/await) to display the first 50 AirBNB listings with listing name, description, amenities, host details with photos, prices, and property thumbnails.

**Live Demo:** https://manasha2402.github.io/airbnb-listings/

**Features:** All listings are linked to actual AIRBNB sites for direct booking. Each listing displays host name and profile photo, top 5 amenities as badges, property descriptions, and pricing information in a clean card-based layout.

**Creative Elements:** Enhanced user experience with real-time search functionality (by name/neighborhood) and price range filtering.

**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript ES6+, Fetch API for AJAX data loading from JSON file.
